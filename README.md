## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Javascript

### What I learned

- I had a tough time disabling a button after it had been clicked once. I am able to fix this by switching to Array. The id of the button clicked is saved in an array, if the id is present in the array (I used array.indexOf to get that), then the button will be disabled, otherwise the button will be clickable.
- I worked extensively with array in this project, using array.splice, array.forEach, array.filter, array.map among others.
- I used Local Storage in saving the task. It was a hard task during the first implementation, but I am able to get comfortable to it at the end.


### Continued development

- Save tasks and total amount to localStorage - DONE
- Allow users to add other task and price.
- Allow user to Send Invoice to a specific email.
